This is the to do list for features that will be added to the project. The project is modelled after a DND character sheet 
and aims to replicate it as close as possible.

1. Code to track ability scores, bonuses, proficiencys, initiative, inspiration. 

2. Code to track equipment, weapons, items, tools.

3. Code to track spells, spell slots.

4. Code to track feats, racial traits, skills.

5. Add race to character header and constructor.

6. Improve(FIX) AS modifier functions [Done] 

7. Add function to auto update stat object assigned to character object. [Done]
    (function now refers to actual object not just a copy of an object)

This list is a rough guide to how the different aspects of a character should be split up and is subject to change
as the project developes.
