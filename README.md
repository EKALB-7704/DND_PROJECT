This is the READ ME for the DND character tracker

The purpose of this project is to create a program to track a person dnd characters, saving the use of seperated files or character sheets.

if possible, we will expand of the scope of this project to allow dungeon masters to manage characters (both player characters and NPCs) for their campaigns.


this project aims to replicate the functionality of a dnd character sheet (Stats, abilities equipment, resources etc.) while adding the efficiency of a computer program.
